# Spotify-Arduino-Controller
Overview:
    As an avid Spotify user I wanted to create a mini controller/display I can use to easily control the Spotify computer app. Using LCD display, Arduino, C++, and python, I was able to display the current Spotify song and artist onto the LCD screen. After fabricating this, I added a joystick that would control volume and skip features of spotify, ultimately enchancing my daily spotify expericence.

Parts Used:  
*Arduino Uno 3  
*16-pin LCD display  
*Variable Potentiometer 
    Used for varying brightness on LCD display
*220 ohm resistor  
*Arduino Joystick module  
*Wires  
*Breadboard
